# Retro_Breakout

A small project I made as an assignment of a programming course. 

This is a version of the classical game of "Breakout" with some extra features and easter eggs. There's a runnable .jar file in the *Tests* directory. Make sure it is in the same directory as *images*, *files* and *fonts*. There may be some bugs here and there.

The code uses Stanfords acm graphics library, which is also included as a .jar file.
